        <h2>Brief Description of the Proposal</h2>
        <p>
            The increasing interest of the scientific community in developing methods to assess climate change and its impacts 
            on natural and human systems poses new challenging tasks in modern statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The newest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released on February 28, 2022, highlights 
            that severe climate change impacts are already happening and, in particular, extreme events have become more frequent 
            and intense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multivariate statistical modelling can provide a fundamental contribution to environmental research by allowing the 
            description of complex interactions between the involved variables, where a major focus is on the occurrence of extremes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the indications of the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Sustainable Development Goals</a> adopted by the United Nations, and in particular Goal 13: 
            <em>“Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”</em>, our proposal aims to investigate some challenging 
            aspects of temporal and spatial modelling concerning specific features of environmental data.
